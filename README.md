# Tomato Disease Detection and Pesticide Recommendation

## Overview

This project implements an AI-driven solution for predicting tomato leaf diseases and recommending appropriate pesticides. The model uses machine learning techniques to classify diseases based on images of tomato leaves and provides pesticide recommendations based on the identified disease.

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Identifies various tomato leaf diseases, including:
  - Bacterial Spot
  - Early Blight
  - Late Blight
  - Leaf Mold
  - Healthy

- **Pesticide Recommendations**: Suggests suitable pesticides for each detected disease with relevant images.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Library**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for model training and testing
